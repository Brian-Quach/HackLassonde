This is a HackLassonde Project for sustainable energy solution.

The goal of this project is to have a web platform for the restaurants that have leftover food, and wish to have 
donate the food to those Torontonian in need of foods. Thus lessen the food waste for the environment.

The problem : Everyday ,  Over 1/3 of all food produced globally goes to waste and the annual value of food wasted globally is $1 trillion, which it weighs 1.3 billion tonnes. This is a huge global problem that needs to get solved immmediately.  
Solution:    We connect the charity organizations to the restaurants and hosts free of charge as well as providing transportations to have the leftover food pick up and delivered to the destination. Providing a platform , not only to connect people with leftover food and needy, but also bridge the gap for solving the issues related to transporting from door to door.
for example: You hosted a party for your graduation and had hundreds of pizza leftover. Rather getting those dunmped, You can just simply create a post , connect with local charities, which will connect the needy with hosts. Volunteers would pick the stuff and get it to the needy! Thats what the power of waste2best !
Our aim is no one is sleeping hungry at the end of the day and we work on a simple old school principle sharing is caring!
